# Identify the problem
# Need to know who won game

# Identify the output that would solve the problem 
# return the token, "X" or "O" that has won the game given a winning board

# Name the Procedure That Fixes the Problem
# If won return type of toke won

# Identify What Inputs are Needed to Create the Output
# Board
# #won? 
# Token : x or o

# Define the Procedureâ€™s Implementation

# return type winning token (board, method, token vale):
#  winning board = won?(board)
# If winning board return type of token that won
